# ProductSentimentAnalysis
Using Machine Learning Algorithms for analyzing Product Sentiment

This project is done using the files provided by University of Washington for the courses provided via Coursera

Objectives:

1.Out of the 11 words in selected_words, which one is most used in the reviews in the dataset?

2.Out of the 11 words in selected_words, which one is least used in the reviews in the dataset? 

3.Out of the 11 words in selected_words, which one got the most positive weight in the selected_words_model? 

4.Out of the 11 words in selected_words, which one got the most negative weight in the selected_words_model?

5.Which of the following ranges contains the accuracy of the selected_words_model on the test_data?

6.Which of the following ranges contains the accuracy of the sentiment_model in the IPython Notebook from lecture on the test_data?

7.Which of the following ranges contains the accuracy of the majority class classifier, which simply predicts the majority class on the test_data?

8.How do you compare the different learned models with the baseline approach where we are just predicting the majority class?   

9.Which of the following ranges contains the ‘predicted_sentiment’ for the most positive review for ‘Baby Trend Diaper Champ’, according to the sentiment_model from the IPython Notebook from lecture?

10.Consider the most positive review for ‘Baby Trend Diaper Champ’ according to the sentiment_model from the IPython Notebook from lecture. Which of the following ranges contains the predicted_sentiment for this review, if we use the selected_words_model to analyze it?

11.Why is the value of the predicted_sentiment for the most positive review found using the sentiment_model much more positive than the value predicted using the selected_words_model?
